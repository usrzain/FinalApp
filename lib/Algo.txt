input variables:

- current location
- list of Charging Stations (

            location,
            Availability = No of slots ( free ),
            Total No of Charging Slots 
            Cost per kWh or charging session,
            Charging speed,
            Real-time queue length

                )

- Input from user : Type of Electric Vehicle ( for Range Calculations)
- Avg speed of EV  ( can calculate with the location something )
- Input from user : Current Charged Level ( added by the user )
- Real time location
- Range of EV ( calculated by using the formula below ).

-----------Range Estimation


Battery capacity (kWh): This represents the total amount of energy your EV's battery can store. It's typically found in the owner's manual or on the manufacturer's website.

Energy consumption (kWh/km or kWh/mile): This indicates how efficiently your EV uses energy to travel a certain distance. It can be found in the owner's manual, fuel economy ratings, or by using trip data from your EV's onboard computer.

Current (SOC ):

Avg Speed :

Theoretical range (km or miles) : Battery capacity (kWh) *Current SOC (%)* 100 / Energy consumption (kWh/km or kWh/mile)



----------Range Estimation

------Fast Charging kwh : 7 kW or 22 kW

----------Time for Charging
 double chargingTime = (100 - soc) / chargingRate;

  // Total energy consumption (kWh)
  double energyConsumed = chargingTime * chargingRate;

  // Cost calculation
  double cost = energyConsumed * costPerKwh;



Decision Factors :

Distance of EV from Charging Station ,
Charging Speed ( user preference ( Level 1,2 or 3 ))
Range of Electric Vehicle ,
SOC at reaching the CS( prediction acc to average speed and range of EV ),
Time at which EV reach at a particular CS,
Time of Charging from 10:00  to 12:00
Availability of Charging Station at that particular time of reaching ,
queue at the Charging Station( time to wait ),
